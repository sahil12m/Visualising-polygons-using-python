# Visualising-polygons-using-python
In this program we construct a polygon from scratch and visualise it with matplotlib.
The program also specifies that if a point with coordinates(x,y) is mentioned, whether that point lies inside or outside the polygon.
Increase the number of coordinates for the polygon list to observe the n-dimensionality.
Download the program and change the coordinates of the point to observe the results.
